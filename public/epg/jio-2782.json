In Florida, Hugh discovers the unusual relationship between the predatory alligator and the placid manatee, while zoologist Lucy Cooke travels to Canada to reveal how raccoons are cleverly adapting to city life. Biologist Patrick Aryee is in Cambodia to explore why the Sun Bear is one of the world's shrewdest animals and conservationist Giles Clark discusses elephants and emotional intelligence while in Kenya.",
