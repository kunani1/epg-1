    "subTitle": "Located just 10 miles from New York's Times Square, the Bronx Zoo is a recognised world leader in animal care and species conservation. It houses more than 6,000 animals and has a staff of 500-plus people dedicated to their care and well-being. Never before have camera crews been granted full access to the 265-acre campus, until production of the docuseries `The Zoo'. The results are stories focusing on dozens of animals and experiences at the facility, and its critical mission to conserve wildlife around the world. Episodes also highlight various employees and how their expertise and skills help provide top-quality care for the animals.",
