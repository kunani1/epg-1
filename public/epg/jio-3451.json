Animals adapt through a series of small, random mutations and usually do so in order to compete more effectively for food, water and space. Crocodiles are certainly of an ancient lineage, they are believed to be 200 million years old. Sharks have gone through the process of adaptation and evolutionary experimentation as well.",
