    "subTitle": "Successfully managing an auto complex that includes a sales and service centre, a custom shop and a junkyard/parts facility keeps Andy Cohen working long hours. It also keeps him up after-hours worrying about maintaining the well-oiled operation. His father, Bobby, opened the junkyard years ago and still helps - or so he thinks - by running it when needed, but his laid-back personality often clashes with Andy's hard-charging style, making a volatile business even more challenging. `Junkyard Empire' follows how father and son work around their relationship dynamic to keep the family empire thriving. As they hunt valuable parts, scrap metal or potential high-end fabrication projects for clients, jack-of-all-trades Andy and semiretired Bobby know how to exploit every greasy part or burned-up engine.",

    "subTitle": "Ladies, start your engines! `All Girls Garage' taps into the expertise of three women repairing cars and motorcycles in a shop setting. The `girls' are certified mechanic Sarah Lateiner, who goes by the nickname `Bogi'; TV host and motorsports reporter Cristy Lee; and mobile automotive repair pioneer Faye Hadley. Producers say the women approach complex projects - from upgrading the RAM Air on a rare Pontiac GTO Judge, to installing an exhaust system on a V10 Audi, to repairing a Suzuki Hyabusa motorcycle - that rival those undertaken by their male counterparts in order to prove they have what it takes to run a female-dominated car shop.",
