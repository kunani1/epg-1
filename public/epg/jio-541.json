In Oklahoma City, for example, racers boast having the fastest street cars in the country, and the racing, they say, comes first - before family, before friends and before work. From a 1969 Chevy Nova to a race-ready farm truck, the vehicles - and their drivers - come in all shapes and sizes and have one thing in common: the need for speed.",

Once complete, the restored car is taken for a test drive, and then Mike negotiates the purchase price with a new owner. The first 13 seasons of `Wheeler Dealers' featured master mechanic Edd China as Brewer's sidekick.",
