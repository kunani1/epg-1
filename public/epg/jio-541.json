    "subTitle": "Successfully managing an auto complex that includes a sales and service centre, a custom shop and a junkyard/parts facility keeps Andy Cohen working long hours. It also keeps him up after-hours worrying about maintaining the well-oiled operation. His father, Bobby, opened the junkyard years ago and still helps - or so he thinks - by running it when needed, but his laid-back personality often clashes with Andy's hard-charging style, making a volatile business even more challenging. `Junkyard Empire' follows how father and son work around their relationship dynamic to keep the family empire thriving. As they hunt valuable parts, scrap metal or potential high-end fabrication projects for clients, jack-of-all-trades Andy and semiretired Bobby know how to exploit every greasy part or burned-up engine.",
