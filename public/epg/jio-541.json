The `girls' are certified mechanic Sarah Lateiner, who goes by the nickname `Bogi'; TV host and motorsports reporter Cristy Lee; and mobile automotive repair pioneer Faye Hadley. Producers say the women approach complex projects - from upgrading the RAM Air on a rare Pontiac GTO Judge, to installing an exhaust system on a V10 Audi, to repairing a Suzuki Hyabusa motorcycle - that rival those undertaken by their male counterparts in order to prove they have what it takes to run a female-dominated car shop.",

Working with a limited budget, Mike's job is to find and purchase a vehicle and oversee all the necessary repairs - and usually there are plenty of them - giving tips along the way about electrics, structural issues, mechanics, cosmetic touches and finishing work. Once complete, the restored car is taken for a test drive, and then Mike negotiates the purchase price with a new owner. The first 13 seasons of `Wheeler Dealers' featured master mechanic Edd China as Brewer's sidekick.",

    "subTitle": "Paul Teutul and his son Paul Jr. create some of the world's most original custom motorcycles - Paul Sr operates Orange County Choppers, and Junior leads his staff at Paul Jr. Designs. Both shops are located a stone's throw from each other in Orange County, NY, but sometimes it seems as if father and son are worlds apart. They were business partners at OCC until a family feud that included a lawsuit led to their separation, both personally and professionally. This reality series follows the hot-headed Teutuls as they strive to remain on speaking terms while their shops compete to outdo each other in the designing and building of custom bikes.",

The proprietors of Gas Monkey Garage in Dallas buy and restore forgotten and fading away American cars, everything from 1931 Model A's to '73 Trans Ams, before selling them at auction. As `Fast N' Loud' documents, Rawlings is the mastermind, the deal-maker with an eye for the relics worth bringing back to life, and to find them the guys scour barns, swap meets and overgrown fields across Texas and surrounding states. The restorations are primarily managed by Kaufman, a fabricator and self-taught mechanic whose sharp skills and design savvy first endeared him to Rawlings and kick-started their partnership.",

    "subTitle": "Successfully managing an auto complex that includes a sales and service centre, a custom shop and a junkyard/parts facility keeps Andy Cohen working long hours. It also keeps him up after-hours worrying about maintaining the well-oiled operation. His father, Bobby, opened the junkyard years ago and still helps - or so he thinks - by running it when needed, but his laid-back personality often clashes with Andy's hard-charging style, making a volatile business even more challenging. `Junkyard Empire' follows how father and son work around their relationship dynamic to keep the family empire thriving. As they hunt valuable parts, scrap metal or potential high-end fabrication projects for clients, jack-of-all-trades Andy and semiretired Bobby know how to exploit every greasy part or burned-up engine.",
