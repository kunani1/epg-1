    "subTitle": "Ladies, start your engines! `All Girls Garage' taps into the expertise of three women repairing cars and motorcycles in a shop setting. The `girls' are certified mechanic Sarah Lateiner, who goes by the nickname `Bogi'; TV host and motorsports reporter Cristy Lee; and mobile automotive repair pioneer Faye Hadley. Producers say the women approach complex projects - from upgrading the RAM Air on a rare Pontiac GTO Judge, to installing an exhaust system on a V10 Audi, to repairing a Suzuki Hyabusa motorcycle - that rival those undertaken by their male counterparts in order to prove they have what it takes to run a female-dominated car shop.",
